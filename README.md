# Controls

Click on the grid to lay bricks

- Tab: flip brick
- Esc: cancel current hover highlighting
- Ctrl + z or Command + z: undo last brick

# Browser compatibility

Works only on Firefox, and requires 40.0.3 or higher. 40.0.3 is probably not
the lowest version the code can support, but it was developed and tested on it.

The code doesn't work in Chrome since Chrome isn't as ES 2015 compliant as
Firefox, and the script type is Firefox specific to enable all the ES 2015 features.
